# UDP Socket Communication Example

This is a simple client-server UDP socket communication example in Python. It demonstrates communication between a client and a server using User Datagram Protocol (UDP).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have [Python](https://www.python.org/) installed on your system.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/udp-socket-communication-example.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd udp-socket-communication-example
   ```

3. Run the server:

   ```bash
   python server.py
   ```

4. Run the client in a separate terminal or script:

   ```bash
   python client.py
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the server script to start the server listening on a specified host and port.

2. Run the client script, which sends a message to the server and receives a response.

3. Enter a string on the client side, and it will be sent to the server. The server responds with an uppercase version of the message.

4. The communication continues until you decide to exit.

## Code Explanation

- `server.py`: Contains the server-side code for binding to an address and handling UDP communication.

- `client.py`: Contains the client-side code for sending a message to the server and receiving the response.

## Customization

You can customize the host and port settings in both `server.py` and `client.py` according to your requirements.

```python
# Example server customization
python server.py --host localhost --port 2000

# Example client customization
python client.py --host localhost --port 2000
```
